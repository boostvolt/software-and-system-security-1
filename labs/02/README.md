# Security Lab – Public File Storage Service

© ZHAW / SoE / InIT – Marc Rennhard

## Virtual Machine

This lab can be done with the VM that is provided to you. The remainder of this document assumes you are working with this VM.

The lab could basically also be done on any Linux system with an installed IDE, Java and nmap. However, it is possible to render a system non-usable by carrying out the attacks in this lab (especially attack 1 in section 6). It's therefore strongly recommended you do this lab using the provided VM.

## 1 Introduction

In this lab, you get the server-side component of a very simple file storage service that is implemented in Java as a basis. Basically, the service allows to store and fetch files, and to execute system commands. The service doesn't use any kind of login, i.e., every user can easily store and fetch files and users can also read and overwrite each other's files. Therefore, the service is intended only for temporary storage of non-sensitive data, e.g., to easily exchange files between two devices of the same user or of different users, like a super simple version of Dropbox. Despite its simplicity, the server component contains several serious vulnerabilities. Your task is to find and understand the vulnerabilities and to correct the code such that the vulnerabilities are no longer present.

One goal of this lab is to «sharpen your awareness» in the sense that you should understand how much can go wrong with respect to security even in a simple program if the developer lacks a profound understanding of software security. Such developers also often assume the user (or attacker) uses standard client software (here: the client component of the file storage service, but you won't use this in this lab) that follows the protocol correctly and only sends well-formed data. But in reality, attackers use specialized tools to arbitrarily interact with a server application, which may allow them to do attacks the developer didn't consider during development.

This lab focuses in particular on input validation and what can happen if input validation is neglected. A significant portion of security vulnerabilities that show up in the wild are related to a lack of input validation and this lab will show you various attacks that can happen in such cases and will also teach you some fundamental techniques to do input validation correctly. The second goal of this lab is therefore to get a good understanding about vulnerabilities and solution approaches in the context of input validation.

## 2 Basis for this Lab

- Download PublicFileStorage.zip from Moodle.
- Move the file to an appropriate location (e.g., into a directory securitylabs in the home directory /home/hacker).
- Unzip the file. The resulting directory PublicFileStorage contains a Java project based on Maven. This should be importable in any modern IDE. The remainder assumes you are using IntelliJ, which is installed on the VM.
- If you haven't activated IntelliJ yet, do so now using the description in SecLab_Using-VM.pdf.
- Start IntelliJ (Applications menu top left => All Applications => IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition) and open the project.
- To build the project, right-click PublicFileStorage at the top left and select Build Module 'PublicFileStorage'.
- Whenever you make changes to the code, they are saved immediately. To rebuild the project, simply select Build Module 'PublicFileStorage' again.
- The executable code is placed in directory PublicFileStorage/target/classes.
- The project contains two programs:
  - **PublicFileStorageServer.java**: The secure file storage server component.
  - **PublicFileStorageTester.java**: A test program to perform different attacks against the server. You can look at the code, but please don't change it! The program uses two command line parameters: The host name or the IP address of the server and a number (0-8) of the attack you want to execute (see sections 4 and 6). Entering no number at all runs all attacks.
- Both programs are located in package ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage, which means the class files are placed in directory ch/zhaw/securitylab/publicfilestorage below PublicFileStorage/target/classes.
- In addition, a file Common.java is included. This includes constants that are used by both programs.
- The server uses the directory files to store the uploaded files. When starting the server, two files file1.txt and file2.txt are already present in this directory. The directory files is located below PublicFileStorage/target/classes.

## 3 Functionality and Protocol

Communication between client and server uses a simple, ASCII-based protocol. Messages from client to server are called requests, messages from server to client are called responses. Overall, three different request types are supported: GET, PUT and SYSTEM. In the following, the request types and how they are used in the communication protocol are described.

### 3.1 GET

GET is used to fetch a file. To get file1.txt, the following request is sent to the server:

```
GET file1.txt
-----DONE-----
```

When the server receives this, the requested file is accessed (in this case files/file1.txt, and its content is sent back to the client as follows:

```
OK
-----CONTENT-----
This is the content of file1.txt.
It even contains a second line.
And a third as well, unbelievable!
-----DONE-----
```

The file content is included line by line between `-----CONTENT-----` and `-----DONE-----`. Note that for simplicity, we assume the files are always text files as this makes it much simpler to print the file content in a terminal (see later). Security-wise, supporting binary files wouldn't change anything. If a problem happens while processing the request, e.g., if the file does not exist, a NOK response is sent back:

```
NOK
-----DONE-----
```

The request and responses above also show some general properties of the protocol used by the file storage service:

- Every request always starts with one of the three request types (GET, PUT, SYSTEM), followed by one or more arguments (here one argument: file1.txt).
- Every response always starts with a response status OK or NOK, depending on whether the request could successfully be handled or not.
- Every request and every response is always terminated with a marker `-----DONE-----`.
- Every part of the request or response uses a separate line. Lines are always terminated with a newline character (`\n`). For instance, the GET request to the server contains two lines – GET file1.txt and `-----DONE-----` – and both lines are terminated with a `\n` character.
- As an additional feature (although not shown in the messages above), the arguments in the first line of a request may be URL encoded (this is also supported by some other ASCII-based protocols, e.g., HTTP). URL encoding uses a % character followed by the hex value of the ASCII code of the character. So for instance, the URL encoded value of A is %41. As a result of supporting URL encoding, the arguments are URL decoded by the server before they are processed further.

### 3.2 PUT

PUT is used to store a file on the server. To create a file testfile.txt with specific content, the following request is sent to the server:

```
PUT testfile.txt
-----CONTENT-----
Test data: Terrific test file content!
Spread across two lines.
-----DONE-----
```

When the server receives this, the file is created (in this case files/testfile.txt) and written with the specified content. If the file already exists, it is overwritten. If the file can be created and (over-) written, the following response is sent back to the client:

```
OK
-----DONE-----
```

If a problem happens while processing the request, the same NOK response as with GET requests is sent back.

For simplicity, no subdirectories are supported, so files can only be written to (and read) from files/, but not to/from, e.g., files/subdir/.

### 3.3 SYSTEM

SYSTEM is used to execute a command in the underlying operating system of the server. The only command that is currently supported is USAGE to get the disk space that is consumed by the files on the server. To get the disk space consumed by the files, the following request is sent to the server:

```
SYSTEM USAGE *
-----DONE-----
```

When the server receives this, the server accesses the du command in the underlying operating system (using `du -h files/*`) and includes the output of the du command in the response as follows:

```
OK
-----CONTENT-----
4.0K files/file1.txt
4.0K files/file2.txt
-----DONE-----
```

Note that du returns the disk usage (i.e., the size of the used disk blocks) and not the effective size of the files, which is why 4.0K is returned for both files. If a problem happens while processing the request, the same NOK response as with GET requests is sent back.

Besides `USAGE *`, the request can also use `USAGE .` (with a dot instead of an asterisk), which returns the total disk usage of all the files on the server.

## 4 Run the Server and Test whether it Works Correctly

First, run the server and test whether it works correctly. To run the server, open a terminal (it's best to always run the programs in a terminal), change to directory PublicFileStorage/target/classes and enter:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageServer
```

Per default, the server uses TCP port 4567. If you want to, you can change this in Common.java, but there's usually no reason to do so.

To test whether the server works correctly, use a second terminal, change again to directory PublicFileStorage/target/classes and enter the command below to run the test program. The command line parameters identify the hostname of the server (localhost) and the number of the test or attack that should be executed. Here, we are using test number 0. Numbers 1 and higher are «reserved» for the actual attacks:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 0
```

The test consists of several requests to test the various request types. The output you get in the terminal of PublicFileStorageTester should be self-explanatory. As an example, test 0a is described:

```
Test 0a: Check GET (file existing)... done
Test **SUCCEEDED**
Status: OK
Content: This is the content of file1.txt belonging to user1.
It even contains a second line.
And a third as well, unbelievable!
Server still running
```

The first line describes the test. Here, a GET request is tested that uses an existing file name. The second line `Test **SUCCEEDED**` means that the test was successful, i.e., it worked as expected. A failure would be indicated with `Test **FAILED**`. Next, there's the status of the received response, which is either OK or NOK – here it is OK because the GET request could successfully be handled. Next, there's the content of the response, which – in this case – contains the content of the requested file. Finally, it is indicated whether the server is still reachable (Server still running) or not (Server crashed).

Whenever you are doing some changes to the server code throughout the remainder of this lab, it's always a good idea to re-run this test to check whether the basic legitimate requests are still handled correctly.

## 5 Source Code Analysis of PublicFileStorageServer.java

Before you start solving the tasks in the next section, you should study the source code of the server to get a good understanding about its functionality. Basically, the program works as follows:

- The main method creates a PublicFileStorageServer object and starts the server (run method).
- In the run method, a while loop is used to listen for connection requests from clients. When a client establishes a connection, the method accept returns and delivers a Socket object, which can be used to communicate with the client. This object is passed to the processRequest method, which handles the specific request. Note that for simplicity, the server runs single-threaded, which means the next connection (from the same or from another client) will only be accepted once the previous request has been completely handled (including sending back the response).
- processRequest reads the first line of the request and checks the type of the request. Depending of this type (GET, PUT or SYSTEM), it calls a corresponding method (serveFile, storeFile or executeSystemCommand), where the remainder of the request is handled and where the response to the client is generated. When processRequest is completed, program control goes back to the run method so the next connection request can be accepted.

Take your time to get a good understanding of the code – you'll need this understanding later in this lab to make the right program adaptations to fix the security vulnerabilities.

## 6 Attacks and Countermeasures

In each of the following subsections, PublicFileStorageTester is used to carry out an attack against the running server. Your task is always the same: First, carry out the attack to see its effect. Then determine the reason why the attack was successful. Next, adapt the server code to fix the vulnerability (this is needed with all attacks except attack 1). Finally, check whether the attack is truly prevented by executing it again, and also check whether test 0 (see section 4) can still be executed successfully.

It's important that you go through the attacks in the given order as in some cases, the attacks build upon attacks and countermeasures of previous subsections. Also, always make sure to completely solve a subsection before starting with the next one. When adapting the code, you should always focus on fixing the vulnerability that allows the current attack and then you should verify whether the vulnerability has indeed been removed by your corrective measures.

The test program tries to «find out» whether an attack can be carried out or whether your corrective measures prevent the attack – the output of the test program provides you with the necessary information. If the test program generates an exception, then this usually means that you haven't fixed the vulnerability correctly (according to the specifications in the individual subsections).

### 6.1 Attack 1: Compromising the root account by setting a new root password

In this attack, you are exploiting vulnerabilities in the server to set a new root password in the underlying system. Before you execute the attack, you should create a copy of the shadow file (which contains the passwords of the system users). This requires root permission and can be done – assuming you are working in a terminal as user hacker – with the sudo command:

```bash
$ sudo cp /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.org
```

Next, start the server so that it runs with root permissions. This is also done with sudo:

```bash
$ sudo java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageServer
```

Finally, execute the attack (which has number 1) by entering the following in another terminal:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 1
```

Inspecting the output of the test program should inform you whether the attack was successful.

Now, try to get root access by using su in a terminal. Use the password test. The login attempt should be successful, which means the root account was indeed compromised by setting a new root password test (the original password was root) in the shadow file.

This can be verified by comparing the original and modified shadow files, e.g., by using diff:

```bash
$ sudo diff /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.org
```

What has changed? What hasn't changed?

**Changed:** Only the root user's password hash (second field in `/etc/shadow`) is replaced with the hash of "test" (`$y$j9T$gnShDAET1KVc7yp81aF.t0$WjeWIbl6mM.PesF1P/q02i3OzQHBZyfXAunZ6WvNBD6`).

**Unchanged:** All other fields of the root account (user ID, group ID, last password change date, min/max password age, warning period, inactivity period, account expiration) and all other user accounts remain intact.

Why are the passwords not directly visible?

Passwords are not stored in plaintext but as cryptographic hashes using the yescrypt algorithm (indicated by `$y$` prefix). The hash is a one-way function that cannot be reversed to obtain the original password. This protects passwords even if the shadow file is compromised.

The fact that this attack was successful has multiple reasons – which ones? To provide a complete answer to this, you'll have to study the source code of the server, and also the requests (especially the first line of them) that are received by the server (for the latter, there's already a code line in method processRequest, but it's currently commented). It may also be helpful using some further debugging messages in the server code (e.g., with System.out.println()).

**Multiple reasons for attack success:**

1. **Path Traversal Vulnerability:** The `serveFile()` and `storeFile()` methods (lines 84-99, 102-121) concatenate user input directly to `FILES_DIR` without validation. The attack uses `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow` to escape the `files/` directory.

2. **No Input Sanitization:** While `urlDecode()` is called on the filename, there is no validation to check for malicious path sequences like `../` or absolute paths.

3. **Running with Elevated Privileges:** When the server runs as root (via `sudo`), it has unrestricted access to read and write system files including `/etc/shadow`.

4. **Request Example:** The attack sends:

   - `GET ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow` (to read the file)
   - `PUT ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow` (to write the modified file)

5. **No Access Control:** The server doesn't implement any whitelisting or sandboxing to restrict file access to the intended `files/` directory.

To remove the effect of the attack, replace the modified shadow file again with the original one:

```bash
$ sudo mv /etc/shadow.org /etc/shadow
```

Next, stop server and restart it, but this time as user hacker:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageServer
```

Execute the attack again. What happens? Explain the behavior.

**When running as non-root user:**

- **Result:** Attack **FAILED** - "shadow file could not be read"
- **Reason:** The `/etc/shadow` file requires root privileges to read/write. When the server runs as a regular user, the OS denies access due to file permissions (typically `600` or `-rw-------` owned by root).
- **Key Insight:** This demonstrates defense-in-depth. Even with the path traversal vulnerability still present in the code, the principle of least privilege prevents exploitation by limiting the server's permissions.

With this, the attack is prevented, because one of the reasons that made it possible has been removed (as the server no longer runs with root permissions). However, the other reasons that made the attack possible (which are vulnerabilities in the code and which you likely identified above) are still there. This will be fixed later.

The important take away message of this attack is that you should never run a program with root privileges (unless this is really necessary), because if there exists a vulnerability, the impact is usually higher when the program runs with root permissions.

**In the following, always run the server as user hacker.**

### 6.2 Attack 2: DoS attack with empty request

Make sure the server is running and execute attack 2:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 2
```

The server should crash. As the server is no longer available for legitimate users, we identify this as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack.

Analyze why the server crashed by studying the request and the source code of the server. The generated exception provides you with hints where in the code you should look. In the following box, explain why the server crashed.

**Why the server crashed:**

The attack sends only a newline character (`\n`) as the request. This causes a crash in the `processRequest()` method (lines 59-61):

```java
int indexSpace = line.indexOf(' ');               // Returns -1 (no space found)
String requestType = line.substring(0, indexSpace); // substring(0, -1) throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
String argument = line.substring(indexSpace + 1);
```

**Root cause:** The code assumes every request contains a space character separating the request type from the argument, but doesn't validate this assumption. When `indexOf(' ')` returns -1, calling `substring(0, -1)` throws an uncaught `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which propagates up and terminates the server process.

**Fix needed:** Add validation to check if `indexSpace >= 0` before calling substring, or handle the exception properly to prevent server crash.

How would you fix this problem? Just think about a possible solution, don't implement anything yet.

**Possible solutions:**

1. **Input Validation:** Check if `indexSpace >= 0` before attempting to parse. If invalid, send NOK response instead of crashing.

2. **Exception Handling:** Wrap the parsing logic in a try-catch block to catch `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` and handle it gracefully.

3. **Regular Expression Validation:** Validate the entire first line matches expected format `(GET|PUT|SYSTEM) <arguments>` before parsing.

**Best approach:** Validate input first using a regular expression that checks for valid protocol format, then parse only if validation succeeds.

Before adapting the code, let's discuss the vulnerability in more detail. As you probably found out above, the problem is that the server tries to process the request, which consists of an empty first line. As a result of this, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. As the exception is not caught, the program is terminated. This is a typical example of a vulnerability related to a lack of input validation. Input validation issues are very prevalent in software and more of them will follow in subsequent attacks. Generally speaking, a lack of input validation means that the software (here the server) blindly accepts and processes input data without validating the data first, i.e., without making sure that it conforms to an expected and legitimate data format before processing it. This can then lead to unexpected and unforeseen situations, which can have serious security implications. Here, it «only» resulted in terminating the server and thereby affects availability, but – as you'll see later – it can also have an impact on confidentiality and integrity.

The solution is to first validate input data before processing it. One reasonable way to do this in the current case is to implement a method with name `validateFirstLineOfRequest(String input)`, which gets the first line of the request as a parameter. The method then checks if the first line consists of a valid format. Looking at the protocol definition in section 3, you can see that a valid first request line consists of the request type (GET, PUT, SYSTEM), followed by one space character, followed by one or more arguments, whereas each argument consists of printable characters (except space characters) and where the arguments are separated by space characters. This format can best be tested using a regular expression and in general, regular expressions play an important role when implementing input validation rules. Using a regular expression, validateFirstLineOfRequest can be implemented as follows:

```java
private boolean validateFirstLineOfRequest(String input) {
    if (input != null && input.matches(
        "^(GET|PUT|SYSTEM) [\\x21-\\x7E][\\x20-\\x7E]*$")) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Study this method, especially the regular expression (in bold). In the following box, explain in detail why the regular expression is suited to validate the format of the first line of a request by describing the purpose of the different parts of the regular expression. Note that the actual regular expression contains only single slashes (`\`), but in a Java string, it's necessary to escape a slash character (using `\\`) so that it is interpreted as a literal slash character. This means that the substring `[\\x21-\\x7E][\\x20-\\x7E]` corresponds to `[\x21-\x7E][\x20-\x7E]` in the actual regular expression.

**Hint:** To play around with regular expressions, and to learn what the individual parts of a regular expression mean, https://regex101.com is an excellent resource.

**Regular expression breakdown:** `^(GET|PUT|SYSTEM) [\x21-\x7E][\x20-\x7E]*$`

- `^` - Start of string anchor (ensures matching from the beginning)
- `(GET|PUT|SYSTEM)` - Matches exactly one of the three valid command types
- ` ` - One literal space character (required separator)
- `[\x21-\x7E]` - One character from hex 21 to 7E (ASCII printable characters excluding space: `!` to `~`). This ensures the first argument character is not a space.
- `[\x20-\x7E]*` - Zero or more characters from hex 20 to 7E (ASCII space through `~`). This allows additional arguments with spaces between them.
- `$` - End of string anchor (ensures no extra characters after)

**Why it works:** This regex ensures the request has a valid command, followed by mandatory space, followed by at least one non-space printable character, followed by any printable characters (including spaces for multiple arguments). It prevents empty requests, requests without arguments, and requests with only spaces as arguments.

Next, call the method above in method processRequest to validate the first line of each request before processing it. If validation fails, respond with NOK. The easiest way to implement this is as follows (new code in bold):

```java
if (line == null) {
    // Apparently, the client disconnected without sending anything, do nothing
} else {
    // System.out.println("First line of request: " + line);
    // Validate the first line of the request
    if (!validateFirstLineOfRequest(line)) {
        writeNOKNoContent(toClient);
        return;
    }
    // Get request type and argument from the first line of the request.
    int indexSpace = line.indexOf(' ');
    ...
```

To verify whether your code modifications have the desired effect, execute the attack again and check the output of the test program. The attack should now fail. Also, repeat test 0 to make sure the server still works as it should when the client uses legitimate requests.

### 6.3 Attack 3: DoS attack with long request

Make sure the server is running and execute attack 3:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 3
```

Again, the server should crash. Analyze the exception, the request and the source code of the server and explain why the server crashed.

**Why the server crashed:**

The attack sends an extremely long first request line (up to 5 GB). When `fromClient.readLine()` is called at line 53 in `processRequest()`, the `BufferedReader` attempts to read the entire line into memory before returning it. This causes an `OutOfMemoryError` as the JVM runs out of heap space trying to allocate a string large enough to hold the massive input.

**Root cause:** The `readLine()` method has no limit on line length and will continue reading until it finds a newline character or reaches end-of-stream. An attacker can exploit this by sending arbitrarily long data without newlines, forcing memory exhaustion.

The client sends a request where the first line of the request has a length of 5 GB. The attack could basically be prevented by assigning the server more memory (in Java, this is possible with the option `-Xmx`, e.g., `-Xmx10G`). Why is this a poor solution for the identified problem?

**Why increasing memory is a poor solution:**

1. **Not scalable:** Attackers can always send requests larger than available memory (e.g., send 15 GB if server has 10 GB)
2. **Resource waste:** Allocating huge amounts of memory for invalid requests wastes resources that legitimate users need
3. **Multiple attackers:** Multiple concurrent malicious requests can still exhaust memory
4. **Doesn't address root cause:** The vulnerability (unbounded input) remains exploitable
5. **Cost:** More memory means higher infrastructure costs just to accommodate attacks

How would you fix this problem? Just think about a possible solution, don't implement anything yet.

**Proper solution:**

Implement a `readLineMaxChar()` method that reads input character-by-character with a maximum length limit (e.g., 1024 or 8192 bytes). If the line exceeds this limit, throw an `IOException` immediately without buffering the entire line. This prevents memory exhaustion while rejecting oversized requests early.

To fix this problem, the best approach is to implement a variant of readLine that only reads a line up to a certain maximum number of characters. Do this by implementing a method readLineMaxChar that uses the following interface:

```java
private String readLineMaxChar(Reader reader, int max) throws IOException {...}
```

The method gets an object reader of type Reader (e.g., a BufferedReader to read data from a socket) and a maximum number of characters to read (max). It then reads a line from reader (terminated with `\n` or end-of-file) and returns it (without the `\n`). If the line is longer than max characters (not counting the `\n`), an IOException is thrown. To prevent an OutOfMemoryError, it's important that you count the read characters while reading them character-by-character from reader and that you throw an IOException as soon as more than max characters have been read (the remaining characters will be ignored in this case). If no data can be read from reader at all (i.e., if the first read operation returns end-of-file), readLineMaxChar should return null.

Then, use this method instead of the standard method readLine in processRequest, i.e., replace:

```java
// Read the first line of the request from the client
String line = fromClient.readLine();
```

with:

```java
// Read the first line of the request from the client
String line;
try {
    line = readLineMaxChar(fromClient, 1000);
} catch (IOException e) {
    writeNOKNoContent(toClient);
    return;
}
```

As you can see, the maximum line length is limited to 1'000 (it's best to use a constant for this). This is certainly good enough to process the first line on any reasonable request. If readLineMaxChar throws an exception (which means the line is longer than 1'000 characters), respond with NOK, as illustrated in the code above.

To verify whether your code modifications have the desired effect, execute the attack again and check the output of the test program. The attack should now fail. Also, repeat test 0 to make sure the server still works as it should when the client uses legitimate requests.

### 6.4 Attack 4: DoS attack with PUT request with a long file line

Make sure the server is running and execute attack 4:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 4
```

Again, the server should crash. Analyze the exception, the request and the source code of the server and explain why the server crashed.

**Why the server crashed:**

Attack 4 sends a valid PUT request header (`PUT longfile.txt\nCONTENT\n`) followed by an extremely long file content line (up to 5 GB without a newline). The crash occurs in the `storeFile()` method at lines 108-111:

```java
String line = fromClient.readLine();
while ((line != null) && (!line.equals(DONE))) {
    fileContent.append(line).append("\n");
    line = fromClient.readLine();
}
```

The `readLine()` call tries to buffer the entire 5 GB line into memory before returning, causing an `OutOfMemoryError`. This is the same vulnerability as Attack 3, but exploiting a different location in the code (file content reading instead of request line parsing).

Having already prevented attack 3, it should be obvious how to prevent attack 4: Make sure that readLineMaxChar is used instead of readLine for all the lines read from the client and not just for the first one. Therefore, adapt the code so that all readLine calls where data is read from the client are replaced with readLineMaxChar (do this throughout the entire code to make sure that all attacks that use too long lines are prevented). For simplicity, we restrict every single line to 1'000 characters, just like above. If readLineMaxChar throws an exception, always respond with NOK. Once you have done these adaptations, all code lines of this form:

```java
line = fromClient.readLine();
```

should have been replaced with code lines of this form (including the necessary exception handling):

```java
line = readLineMaxChar(fromClient, 1000);
```

To verify whether your code modifications have the desired effect, execute the attack again and check the output of the test program. The attack should now fail. Also, repeat test 0 to make sure the server still works as it should when the client uses legitimate requests.

### 6.5 Attack 5: DoS attack with PUT request with many lines

Make sure the server is running and execute attack 5:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 5
```

Again, the server should crash. Analyze the exception, the request and the source code of the server and explain why the server crashed.

**Why the server crashed:**

Attack 5 sends a PUT request with millions of short lines (each 500 bytes), totaling over 2 GB of data. The vulnerability is in the `storeFile()` method at lines 107-112:

```java
StringBuilder fileContent = new StringBuilder();
String line = fromClient.readLine();
while ((line != null) && (!line.equals(DONE))) {
    fileContent.append(line).append("\n");
    line = fromClient.readLine();
}
```

While each individual line is short, the `StringBuilder` accumulates all lines in memory before writing to disk. With millions of lines, the total memory consumption exceeds the JVM heap, causing an `OutOfMemoryError`.

**Root cause:** No limit on the number of lines or total file size. The server attempts to buffer the entire file in memory regardless of size.

Again, it shouldn't be too difficult to identify the problem. Fix the vulnerability in storeFile by making sure that a file that should be stored cannot contain more than 1'000 lines. If there are more than 1'000 lines, respond with NOK. This means that in combination with the fix introduced in the previous subsection, a file can contain at most 1'000 lines, where each line cannot be longer than 1'000 characters. Note again that these limitations are chosen quite arbitrarily and in a real application, you'd probably choose other bounds; but what's important is that you realize that you have to specify and enforce some upper bound for the file size as otherwise, DoS conditions will likely occur.

To verify whether your code modifications have the desired effect, execute the attack again and check the output of the test program. The attack should now fail. Also, repeat test 0 to make sure the server still works as it should when the client uses legitimate requests.

With this attack, we are stepping away from DoS attacks that target the availability. Maybe you found attacks 2-5 a bit repetitive as the attacks are all somewhat similar in the sense that they triggered different exceptions in the server that all resulted in terminating the running program. But exactly this is an important lesson that you should take away from attacks 2-5: In many cases, there are different ways to achieve an attack goal (here: four different ways to crash the server) and the attacker just needs to find one of these ways to be successful. So if you prevent three of the attacks by fixing the associated vulnerabilities but don't fix the fourth vulnerability, the attacker still wins if he finds the remaining vulnerability. Therefore, when thinking about possible attacks against the system you are developing (which is a very important activity during a secure software development process), you should always consider many different ways how a specific attack goal can be achieved and then you should make sure that all these ways are prevented in the code. In this sense, attacks 2-5 certainly gave you a taste what it means to prevent all different ways to achieve an attack goal and to truly achieve secure software.

### 6.6 Attack 6: Getting a file that shouldn't be accessible (variant 1)

Make sure the server is running and execute attack 6:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 6
```

This should give access to file /etc/passwd on the server. Note that other files on the server can also be read provided that the running server process has the necessary rights to do this. This is obviously a bad vulnerability as it may provide an attacker with access to files that contain possible sensitive information. The attacker could also, for instance, access the .java files of the running server application to analyze the code for further vulnerabilities or to sell the code to others (assuming it were a valuable application).

Analyze the request and the source code of the server and explain why it is possible to get the file.

**Why the attack succeeds:**

Attack 6 exploits a **path traversal vulnerability** by sending:

```
GET ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

The vulnerability is in the `serveFile()` method at line 87:

```java
String filepath = FILES_DIR + urlDecode(filename);
```

**How it works:**

1. The server concatenates `FILES_DIR` (`files/`) with the user-supplied filename
2. `urlDecode()` is called to decode URL encoding, but no validation or sanitization occurs
3. The `../` sequences traverse up the directory tree, escaping the intended `files/` directory
4. Multiple `../` sequences are used to ensure reaching the root directory regardless of the actual depth
5. The final path resolves to `/etc/passwd`, which the server reads and returns

**Root cause:** No validation to prevent directory traversal sequences (`../`) or to restrict file access to the `files/` directory.

How would you fix this problem? Just think about a possible solution, don't implement anything yet.

**Solution:**

Validate the filename to disallow:

1. **Slash characters (`/`)**: Prevents directory traversal
2. **Special sequences like `..`**: Prevents parent directory access
3. **Absolute paths**: Ensures filenames are relative

**Best approach:** Use a whitelist regex to only allow safe characters (alphanumeric + safe special chars like `_+=$%?,.;:`) and restrict length (e.g., 1-100 chars). This prevents any path traversal attempts while allowing legitimate filenames.

The best way to fix this is again with input validation. Basically, you have to make sure that the filename specified in the GET request does not contain the slash (/) character, so it's not possible to escape «upwards» from the directory where the files are stored (here: files/).

Implement this by first providing a method validateFilename that gets the filename received in a GET request and that checks that the filename is legitimate. Do this again with a regular expression. In our case, assume a legitimate filename has a length between 1 and 100 characters and allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the following special characters: `_+=$%?,.;:`. Specifying the number of characters in a regular expression can be done with curly brackets that follow a character set (which is defined in square brackets). For instance, `[abcde]{5,10}` matches any sequence of lowercase characters a-e of length between 5 and 10 (including 5 and 10).

Then, use validateFilename right at the beginning of serveFile to validate the received filename. If it is not valid, respond with NOK. Also, do the same check at the beginning of storeFile, so an attacker cannot (over-)write arbitrary files on the system.

To verify whether your code modifications have the desired effect, execute the attack again and check the output of the test program. The attack should now fail. Also, repeat test 0 to make sure the server still works as it should when the client uses legitimate requests.

The attack discussed in this subsection is also called directory traversal attack as the attacker traverses the directory tree to access areas that shouldn't be accessible by him. In addition, the validation of the filename you just added has two beneficial side effects:

- As the / character can no longer be used, it is enforced that a user cannot create or read files in subdirectories files/. This was specified Section 3, but so far, it was not enforced in the code.
- Attack 1 also makes use of a directory traversal attack. This means that with the newly added validation of the filename, attack 1 should not be possible anymore, even if the server runs with root permissions. Verify this by repeating attack 1 – it should fail.

### 6.7 Attack 7: Getting a file that shouldn't be accessible (variant 2)

Make sure the server is running and execute attack 7:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 7
```

This should again give access to file /etc/passwd on the server. Hmm... didn't we just prevent this when discussing attack 6? So apparently, there's (at least) one additional vulnerability still present to achieve this attack goal.

Analyze the request and the source code of the server and explain why it is possible to get the file.

**Why the attack succeeds:**

Attack 7 uses **URL-encoded path traversal**:

```
GET ..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
```

Where `%2F` is the URL encoding for `/`.

**Vulnerability chain:**

1. In `processRequest()` (line 61), the argument is extracted from the request line
2. The filename validation (if implemented for Attack 6) checks for `/` characters
3. The URL-encoded string `..%2F..%2F...` doesn't contain literal `/` characters, so it passes validation
4. Later in `serveFile()` (line 87), `urlDecode()` is called, converting `%2F` to `/`
5. The decoded path `../../../../etc/passwd` is then used to access the file

**Root cause:** Validation happens **before** URL decoding, allowing attackers to bypass checks by encoding malicious characters.

This attack shows that input validation is not always as easy as it seems because although we made sure in the previous subsection that filenames with slashes (/) are not accepted, directory traversal attacks are apparently still possible.

How would you fix this problem? Just think about a possible solution, don't implement anything yet.

**Solution:**

**Critical principle: Always decode first, then validate.**

1. Move `urlDecode()` to `processRequest()` immediately after extracting the argument
2. Perform all validation (regex checks) on the **decoded** data
3. Remove `urlDecode()` calls from `serveFile()`, `storeFile()`, and `executeSystemCommand()`

This ensures validation sees the actual characters that will be used, preventing encoding-based bypasses.

This attack shows that supporting encoding schemes (here: URL encoding) is potentially dangerous as it may allow attacks that are often overlooked during development. The easy fix here would simply be to not support URL encoding at all, but let's assume that this is an important and mandatory feature in the file storage server that cannot be ignored. So let's implement it in a secure way.

Basically, the secure approach to deal with encoding schemes is to do the decoding first and do all further security checks on the decoded data. Therefore, first remove all calls of urlDecode in methods serveFile, storeFile and executeSystemCommand., as these calls are currently done after the data has been validated. Then, use urlDecode in processRequest right when extracting the argument from the first line of the request:

```java
int indexSpace = line.indexOf(' ');
String requestType = line.substring(0, indexSpace);
String argument = urlDecode(line.substring(indexSpace + 1));
```

This guarantees that from now on, we are working with the raw decoded data and no longer have to worry about potentially encoded characters that may circumvent subsequent security checks.

To verify whether your code modifications have the desired effect, execute the attack again and check the output of the test program. The attack should now fail. Also, repeat test 0 to make sure the server still works as it should when the client uses legitimate requests.

### 6.8 Attack 8: Do a portscan on the server

Make sure the server is running and execute attack 8:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost 8
```

As a result of this, you first get the disk space (output of the command du) used by the files, followed by the output of a portscan (with nmap) that was done locally on the server system. A portscan is just used as an example here, other commands that are available on the server system could be used as well (e.g., to download and install malware).

Analyze the request and the source code of the server and explain why it is possible to do the portscan.

**Why the attack succeeds:**

Attack 8 exploits a **command injection vulnerability** by sending:

```
SYSTEM USAGE *; nmap localhost
```

The vulnerability is in the `executeSystemCommand()` method at line 136:

```java
cmd[2] = "du -h " + FILES_DIR + options;
```

**How it works:**

1. The server receives `USAGE *; nmap localhost` as the command
2. It splits this into `actualCommand = "USAGE"` and `options = "*; nmap localhost"`
3. The options are concatenated directly into the shell command: `du -h files/ *; nmap localhost`
4. The command is executed via `/bin/sh -c`, which interprets the semicolon (`;`) as a command separator
5. The shell first executes `du -h files/ *`, then executes `nmap localhost`
6. Both outputs are returned to the client

**Root cause:** User input (`options`) is directly concatenated into a shell command without validation or sanitization. The semicolon allows command chaining, enabling arbitrary command execution with the server's privileges.

Apparently, the attack makes it possible to execute basically arbitrary commands on the server system and that's definitely another major vulnerability. This kind of attack is often identified as command injection.

Obviously, this is another case for input validation. Therefore, implement a method validateCommand that makes sure only valid commands can be used by the clients. Up to now and according to section 3.3, the only valid command is USAGE and it either needs \* or . as an option. This can easily be enforced by using a regular expression. Once implemented, use validateCommand right at the beginning of method executeSystemCommand. If validation fails, respond with NOK.

To verify whether your code modifications have the desired effect, execute the attack again and check the output of the test program. The attack should now fail. Also, repeat test 0 to make sure the server still works as it should when the client uses legitimate requests.

### 6.9 Check that all tests work and that all attacks are prevented

As a final check, run PublicFileStorageTester without a test or attack number:

```bash
$ java ch.zhaw.securitylab.publicfilestorage.PublicFileStorageTester localhost
```

Inspect the output in detail. All tests in the beginning (test 0) should succeed and all attacks (attacks 1-8) should fail. If that's the case: congratulations, you have significantly improved the security of the file storage service! If that's not the case, correct the code until everything works as expected.

## Lab Points

In this lab, you can get 2 Lab Points. To get them, you must demonstrate that you successfully fixed the security vulnerabilities in the server program. This means that when running PublicFileStorageTester without a test or attack number (as described in section 6.9), test 0 should still work and attacks 1-8 should be prevented. Furthermore, you must provide reasonable answers to the questions in section 6 (write them directly into the boxes or into a separate document). Also, if requested by the instructor, you have to describe the changes you did in the source code to fix the vulnerabilities. Handing in your solution can be done in two different ways:

- Show and explain your answers and demonstrate your solution to the instructor in classroom, during the official lab lessons.
- Create screenshots or make a video of a terminal that shows the correctly running PublicFileStorageTester program and send this together with your answers to the questions in section 6 by e-mail to the instructor. Use **SecLab - Public File Storage Service - group X - name1 name2** as the email subject, corresponding to your group number and the names of the group members. If the video is too big for an e-mail, place it somewhere (e.g., SWITCHdrive) and include a link to it in the e-mail.
